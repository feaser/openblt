MicroTBX-Modbus is a modern Modbus communication stack, targeting microcontroller based embedded systems. Its aim is to be: easy to use, easy to port, high quality, well maintained, stable and flexible. The ideal solution for any embedded software engineer, with an interest in adding Modbus communication to their product.

Features:

* Carefully crafted application programming interface (API), focusing on ease of use.
* Written in the C programming language (C99) with high MISRA compliance.
* Supports both Modbus client and Modbus server functionality.
* Supports multi channel for both the Modbus client and server.
* Flexible [dual licensing](https://feaser.github.io/microtbx-modbus/licensing/) model.
* Designed such that it can be used with and without and RTOS.
* Easy to integrate into existing software projects, especially when using CMake.
* Includes C++ wrappers for those preferring to develop in an object-oriented manner.
* Quick and simple to adjust to your microcontroller system.
* No compile-time configuration needed.
* Option to implement additional and custom Modbus function codes.

## Getting Started

To get started with MicroTBX-Modbus, it is recommended to download the latest stable release from the [releases](https://github.com/feaser/microtbx-modbus/releases/) page. Next, follow the integration steps outlined on the first page of the [user manual](https://feaser.github.io/microtbx-modbus).

Additionally, an assortment of demo programs is available in a separate Git repository:
