Important - Read carefully: This Source and Object Code Software License 
Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual 
or legal entity) and Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI"). The "Licensed 
Materials" subject to this Agreement include the software programs (in whole or 
in part) that accompany this Agreement [and set forth in the applicable 
software manifest] and which you access "on-line" and/or electronic 
documentation (in whole or in part) associated and provided with these software 
programs, as well as any updates or upgrades to such software programs and 
documentation, if any, provided to you at TI's sole discretion. The Licensed 
Materials are specifically designed and licensed for use solely and exclusively 
with semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI ("TI Devices"). By 
installing, copying or otherwise using the Licensed Materials you agree to 
abide by the provisions set forth herein. This Agreement is displayed for you 
to read prior to using the Licensed Materials. If you choose not to accept or 
agree with these provisions, do not download or install the Licensed Materials.

Note Regarding Possible Access to Open Source Software: The Licensed Materials 
may be bundled with Open Source Software. "Open Source Software" means any 
software licensed under terms requiring that (A) other software ("Proprietary 
Software") incorporated, combined or distributed with such software or 
developed using such software: (i) be disclosed or distributed in source code 
form; or (ii) otherwise be licensed on terms inconsistent with the terms of 
this Agreement, including but not limited to permitting use of the Proprietary 
Software on or with devices other than TI Devices, or (B) require the owner of 
Proprietary Software to license any of its patents to users of the Open Source 
Software and/or Proprietary Software incorporated, combined or distributed with 
such Open Source Software or developed using such Open Source Software.

By accepting this Agreement, you may gain access to Open Source Software, in 
which case such Open Source Software will be listed in the applicable software 
manifest (in whole or in part, the "Open Source Materials"). Your use of the 
Open Source Materials is subject to the separate licensing terms applicable to 
such Open Source Materials as specified in the applicable software manifest. 
For clarification, this Agreement does not limit your rights under, or grant 
you rights that supersede, the license terms of any applicable Open Source 
Materials license agreement. If any of the Open Source Materials have been 
provided to you in object code only, TI will provide to you, or show you where 
you can access, the source code versions of such Open Source Materials if you 
contact TI at Texas Instruments Incorporated, 12500 TI Boulevard, Mail Station 
8638, Dallas, Texas 75243, Attention: Contracts Manager, Embedded Processing. 
In the event you choose not to accept or agree with the terms in any applicable 
Open Source Materials license agreement, you must terminate this Agreement.
