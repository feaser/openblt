/* XCP on Modbus RTU
 * -----------------
 * The XCP packets are embedded inside a Modbus RTU packet using a user-defined function
 * code. The (configurable) user-defined function code is 109 by default. When embedding
 * the XCP packet, an additional XCP packet length byte is added:
 *
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | Node ID | Fcn Code | XCP len |        XCP data                 |       CRC        |
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This extra length byte is theoretically not needed, because the T3_5 end-of-packet
 * time event informs you when the packet reception is done. However, a Windows or Linux
 * based OS is typically used on the host side. Being a non real-time OS makes detecting
 * the exact T3_5 timeout tricky. The best approach is to wait way longer than T3_5,
 * otherwise the T3_5 timeout is sometimes already detected between bytes of the same
 * packet. Although this works, it causes unnecessary delays between Modbus RTU packets.
 *
 * By having the extra XCP length embedded, you can determine when the last Modbus RTU
 * packet byte was received, without having to rely on the T3_5 end-of-packet time event.

/** \brief This module embeds the bootloader's XCP communication packets inside Modbus
 *         RTU communication packets. As this is a non-standard functionality of Modbus,
 *         a user-defined function code is used to extend the Modbus functionality for
 *         the purpose of embedded XCP packets. User-defined function codes are allowed,
 *         as long as they are in the range 65..72 or 100..110. By default, the user-
 *         defined function code 109 is selected. However, some other Modbus device on
 *         the network might also already use this. For this reason, you can override
 *         the assigned function code by placing this macro in "blt_conf.h" with a
 *         different value assigned to it.
